MATLAB Scripts:
- Wrist_model_example.m     Run SPICE model of the Wrist with plotting functions

Getting Started:
- Install MATLAB. This is commercial software available from The MathWorks. For system requirements and installation instructions, please refer to their documentation.
- Install LTSPICE Simulator. It is a free SPICE simulator from Analog Devices. Download link: https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html
- Update the variable "net.param.ltspice_path" in MATLAB function "img_gen_fn.m" with your LTSPICE.exe path
- Run the required MATLAB Script

Notes:
- These MATLAB files were tested using MATLAB 2019b version
